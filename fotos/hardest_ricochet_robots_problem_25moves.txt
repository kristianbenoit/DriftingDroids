We have strongly solved Ricochet Robots by finding an solution with the fewest moves for every possible starting position, and we have verified that the 24-move solution to the above problem is optimal.

Here is one of the hardest Ricochet Robots problems (sorry for the poor quality image; the active robot is the blue one furthest to the right, and the target is the triangle):

I'll post the solution for this puzzle at a later date. Have fun!

The number of moves for this puzzle is also the answer to the OP's question: "How many moves does it take to solve the hardest possible Ricochet Robots problem?"
The maximum number of moves for any Ricochet Robots problem is 25.
